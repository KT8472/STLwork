	<h2>Plan for the day</h2>
	<p>Alot of people
               ditch and feel great for about an
               hour. Then they realize there's
               nothing to do. TV and food. I myself
               have ditched and gotten so bored I
               did homework.</p><p> You have to plan things out before
               you take the day off. Otherwise
               you get all nervous worrying about
               what to do and all you get is grief
               and the whole point is to take it
               easy, cut loose and enjoy.</p>

	<h2>Explantion</h2>
	<p>Parents always fall for the clammy hands.
               It's physical evidence of illness. It's
               a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are
               generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
               And to make them work you have to go a hundred
               and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous
               mother and you end up in a doctor's office
               and that's worse than school.<img src="img/ferris3.jpg" class="floatleft"/> </p><br><p>Fake a stomach cramp and when you're
               doubled over, moaning and wailing, just
               lick your palms. It's a little stupid
               and childish but then so is high school.
               Right?</p>
